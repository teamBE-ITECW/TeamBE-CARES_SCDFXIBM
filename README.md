We are TEAM BE from ITE College WEst 
Increasing of seniors by Year 2030. To innovate a Wearable technology (low powered, bluetooth) that monitors and notifies community first responders to possible incidents that requires immediate aid. 
A chatbot as Personal Health Assistant for our senior to be integrated in myResponder mobile app.

Architecture of Proposed Solution: The wearable watch would link to mobile phone and submit important data into IBM cloud and notify People Association if there is an inconsistent heart rate (detected), no activity for a duration, as well as trip and fall. 
There will be also a chatbot integrated into myResponder app whereby seniors would be able to acess their average heart rate, compared with their age group, and also emergency numbers.
